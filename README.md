# LLM Web App

## Overview

This project is a web application developed using Streamlit as the frontend and SQLite3 as the database. The application leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language questions into SQL queries and provide answers from the database. It aims to offer a seamless and intuitive experience for users to interact with their data through natural language.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language to SQL Conversion**: Users can input questions in natural language, and the application will generate the corresponding SQL queries.
- **SQL Query Display**: For transparency, the generated SQL queries are displayed to the user.
- **Query Result Download**: Users can download the results of their queries as CSV files.
- **Query History**: The application maintains a history of all queries executed by the user for easy reference and repeated use.
- **Multilingual Support**: To cater to a diverse user base, the application supports multiple languages for both input and output.
